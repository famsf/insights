Planned in edition of 150, only slightly more than half were actually produced. <br></p><p>The text is presented in a radical format, printed in several colors in more than two dozen typefaces. Sometimes tethered to the left margin, sometimes to the right, the poem wanders through fields of applied color.

The disruptive clash between more orthodox expression and that of the avant-garde was the defining spirit of the time (the battlefields of modernism in their own way foreshadowed the battlefields of 1914, when many artists and poets – including Leger, Cendrars, and Apollinaire – eagerly enlisted for combat).

Igor Stravinsky’s discordant music touched off outrage from the more conservative audience members, with others equally vehement in its defense.

In composition, they share a common conceit: the illusion that they were composed, or narrated, in a single sitting, the intimate testimonial quality of a tale of alienation and transgression drawing the listener or reader in. Both are road-trip stories, with socially marginalized traveling companions, that move across vast landscapes. Both are simultaneously life-changing inward journeys. And anyone who has seen the Kerouac manuscript, the scroll, will immediately recognize the physical resemblance. With visual art, though, the two reading experiences diverge, and it is the hybrid nature of what we are looking at that distinguishes La prose as a unique and transcendent experience for the reader and viewer.</p>","Content_Quote":"\n","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"1","id":7846185,"tier":5,"items":[]},{"_id":7846189,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":7846115,"_template_id":1370542,"_custom_state_id":1208751,"_position":"2","_name":"The 1960s","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2018-08-28 16:00:40","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2018-08-29 19:58:43","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208751","is_default":false,"position":"5","color":"#0e90d2","name":"Approval","description":"Content to be approved by key stakeholders.

It meant she was to assume the burden of maintaining [raising] and educating the children.” Separated for eighteen years, they never divorced and regularly corresponded until 1897.

This aspect of Gauguin’s biography can be challenging for some contemporary viewers given current views about sexual morality and women’s rights. </p><p> </p><p>While living in Tahiti and the Marquesas, Gauguin had relationships with at least three women: Teha’amana (Tahiti), Pau’ura a Tai (Pahura) (Tahiti), and Vaeoho Marie-Rose (Marquesas Islands), who each bore one or more of Gauguin’s children. These companions ranged in ages from 13 to 15, within the legal age of consent (13 in France at that time; 10 in California), and at least two of the relationships were perhaps facilitated by adult relatives. However, the women’s own preferences in entering these relationships are not documented or otherwise known. They were mentioned in his letters, featured in his journals, and were the subjects of many of his most striking artworks. They appear as models, muses, mothers, companions, and lovers—and as a Tahitian Eve. While Gauguin is the source for most of what we know about the lives of these young women, new research is revealing more about their personal stories. </p>","Content_Quote":"\n","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"1","id":8108118,"tier":5,"items":[]}]}]}]},{"_id":8108121,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":8096460,"_template_id":1370626,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"5","_name":"Chapter 4: Spiritual Journey and Legacy","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2018-10-09 23:25:34","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2018-11-01 21:12:43","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

Here I find the wild, the primitive. When my clogs echo on this granite earth, I hear the dull, muffled, powerful note that I am seeking in painting.” Gauguin’s <em>Landscape from Brittany with Breton Women</em> shows Brittany as an isolated French province, where time seems to stand still. The women wear their local dress complete with elaborate headdresses, and a cow ambles freely through a village. In Brittany, peasant beliefs blended Catholicism with ancestral practices, providing Gauguin with a world of symbols to inspire his art and spirituality.</p><p> </p><p>After his arrival in Tahiti, Gauguin was eager to learn about Tahitian beliefs from local residents and sites. In his partially fictional memoir, <em>Noa Noa</em>, which he later published in Paris to promote his Tahitian paintings, Gauguin describes receiving instruction about Tahitian theology from his <em><span>vahine</span></em>—companion and model—called Tehura (Teha’amana). However, it is evident that he drew heavily on an account of the islands by Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, <em><span>Voyages aux îles du Grand océan</span></em>, (<em><span>Travels to the Islands of the Pacific Ocean</span></em>), published in 1837. He used the text to infuse his paintings with religious images and themes. Although it looks like a painting from Tahiti, Gauguin painted <em><span>Reclining Tahitian Women</span></em> in Brittany in 1894 after his first sojourn to the islands.</p>","Content_Quote":"\n","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"1","id":8108132,"tier":5,"items":[]}]}]},{"_id":8210990,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":8108121,"_template_id":1398142,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"5","_name":"Ch. 4 image with zoom markers (inline)","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2018-11-02 18:32:30","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2018-11-02 18:34:02","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.
