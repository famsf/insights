As Post-Impressionist artists such as Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, and Vincent van Gogh transformed the art world, paving the way for the modernist art movements of the 20th century, Monet continued to advance his own style. After his initial introduction of a revolutionary use of color and bold brushstrokes, Monet started painting in series in 1891. His first exhibition of serial works featured compositions of haystacks in the fields surrounding Giverny. Creating a series of works focused on a single subject allowed Monet to demonstrate the level of exacting observation and meticulous skill involved in capturing changes in weather, atmosphere, and light. These works in part silenced critics who had accused the Impressionists of being overly spontaneous and haphazard. </p><p><br/>During the first two decades of the 20th century, Monet continued to evolve his style. While Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp, and Fernand Léger made headlines with their own artistic visions, which minimized the importance of observing nature, Monet remained steadfast in his focus on his gardens. He brought vitality and interest to his work by evolving his brushstroke, which became broader and more layered, and significantly expanding the scale of his compositions. These stylistic innovations would crystalize in the artist’s most ambitious project, the <em>Grandes Décorations</em>, installed in the Musée de l’Orangerie in 1927, after the artist’s death, as a gift to the French state.</p>","Content_Quote":"","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"0","id":8413729,"tier":6,"items":[]}]},{"_id":8413706,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":8413704,"_template_id":1370151,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"0","_name":"Left column","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2019-01-09 21:43:59","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2020-02-20 08:10:18","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

I am just scratching and wearing out canvases.” Time did not relieve Monet’s anxiety. His letters with Georges Clemenceau document the artist’s constant misgivings and the elder statesman’s unfailing encouragement to keep working. At times Monet’s anxiety would turn into anger, which he exercised against his canvases. In 1908 Lilla Cabot Perry, an American artist, reported that Monet burned 30 canvases.

The artist was diagnosed with cataracts in 1912, at age 72, but his eyesight had begun to fail several years earlier. At this time, his brushstrokes became broader, and his hues became darker and muddier, with more brown, yellow, and purple. Fearful of cataract surgery, Monet turned to lenses and eye drops to improve his vision but eventually capitulated to surgery in 1923.

Comprising a body of painters and sculptors exclusively patronized by the monarch, the French Royal Academy promoted art-making in France through its teaching and exhibition programs. Elected artists, called Academicians, governed the institution and held the sole privilege of exhibiting at the Salon at its inception. Outlasting nine political regimes, the Salon drew its last breath in 1880.</p><p><br/>Likely as a response to the French Salon, the British Royal Academy of Arts quickly launched the Summer Exhibition following its formation in 1768. Founded by a consortium of painters, sculptors, and architects and backed by King George III, the British Royal Academy emerged as the foremost private art institution in Great Britain. The Summer Exhibition, which continues to this day, employed an open call for submissions not unlike that of <em>The de Young Open.</em> This setup enabled both Academicians and independent artists to exhibit, with the ultimate selections made by the former.</p>","Content_Quote":"","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"0","id":12036819,"tier":5,"items":[]}]},{"_id":12036794,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":12036791,"_template_id":1370151,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"1","_name":"Left column slider SS","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2021-01-04 18:35:08","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2021-01-04 18:35:46","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

Planned in an edition of 150, only slightly more than half were actually produced. </p><p>The text is presented in a radical format, printed in several colors in more than two dozen typefaces. Sometimes tethered to the left margin, sometimes to the right, the poem wanders through fields of applied color.

The long free-verse lines, with their paratactic structure and repetition, remind one of Walt Whitman, but the voice of this poem is hardly Whitman’s oracular one.

It draws on a broad and deep range of scholarship and other resources that have been made available to us. Foremost among these resources is the Reva and David Logan Collection of Illustrated Books itself, a gift of inestimable value presented by the Logans to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 1998. </p><p>Since 2016, we have received significant ongoing financial support from Logan family foundations. We would particularly like to thank Jonathan Logan and the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation for making possible the current website, a related symposium, and much more. Jonathan has championed this project since its inception in 2015. Special thanks also to Daniel Logan and the Revada Foundation for supporting our work in 2021, extending our ability to further document and research the collection and present our findings to a broader public. We thank the Achenbach Graphic Arts Council for a supplemental grant this year that helped support work on the Logan Collection database by AGAC Logan Fellow Araceli Bremauntz-Enriquez, whose work has been exemplary. </p><p>For the Iliazd project:</p><p>We give wholehearted thanks to François Mairé, Iliazd's stepson and custodian of the artist's legacy. Mairé, who leads the Iliazd Club in France, has graciously authorized us to reproduce much of the archival material we have presented here and has offered suggestions and corrections for the website.</p><p>Boris Fridman, a prominent collector and curator of Iliazd's oeuvre, has made several visits to San Francisco, providing us with catalogs of exhibitions and sharing his knowledge and high opinion of the artist's importance in the history of twentieth-century art.</p><p>Johanna Drucker's writing on Iliazd has been invaluable. Her long-awaited book <em>Iliazd: A Meta-Biography of a Modernist</em>, by far the most complete and authoritative account in English of Iliazd's life and work, was published in late 2020 by Johns Hopkins University Press. It is a must-read for anyone interested in this artist. Before her book's publication, Johanna graciously agreed to read over an earlier version of our website's text and made several suggestions and corrections. Her work on Iliazd extends back at least to 1988, with an article in <em><span>The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts. </span></em>She later gave prominent mention to the artist in her 1996 book, <em><span>The Century of Artists' Books</span></em>; many of its readers encountered Iliazd there for the first time. </p>","Content_Quote":"","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"0","id":12872981,"tier":6,"items":[]}]},{"_id":12872585,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":12872579,"_template_id":1370151,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"2","_name":"Right","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2021-06-09 03:34:24","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2021-06-09 19:55:33","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

We have drawn heavily on the essay here. Over the years, she has continued to be a leader in Iliazd scholarship. </p><p>Thomas Kitson's introduction to his translation of Iliazd's novel, <em>Rapture</em>, published in 2017 by Columbia University Press, has also been invaluable. It contains essential information about the artist's artistic development, drawing to some extent on scholarship published in Russia. Funding from the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation has allowed us to commission Kitson's English translations from Russian in Iliazd's artists' books, which we are making freely available. </p><p>David Sume's 2019 doctoral dissertation at the University of Montréal, <em>The Architectural Nature of the Illustrated Books of Iliazd</em>,<em><span> </span></em>is an impressively deep analysis of the structural properties of Iliazd's books, providing us with many insights.</p><p>We are grateful to Andrei Ustinov, an important scholar of Russian Futurism, who read this website's manuscript and made several additions and corrections.</p><p>In France, Régis Gayraud, a prominent writer and scholar of Iliazd and his time, is an authoritative source. Also in France, the acclaimed writer André Markowicz has translated much of Iliazd's Russian text into French and has written movingly of working as a young scholar on Iliazd's archive with Iliazd's widow, Hélène. </p><p>Many thanks to Radek Skrivanek of Axis Point Studios for his stellar animation work.</p><p>Finally, colleagues at the Fine Arts Museums who have supported this work include Karin Breuer, Curator in Charge at the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts; in Web and Digital Production, Diana Murphy, Meenal Tyagi, Simone Polgar, director Patricia Buffa, and Andrew Fox; in Photo Services, director Sue Grinols and photographers Randy Dodson and Jorge Bachman; and Digital Asset and Rights Manager Robert Carswell.

In deviating from this norm, Iliazd transcended the genre. By creating visual forms for literature and a deeply engaging experience for the reader, he turned the book into a multidimensional, interactive work of art. If his books are a far cry from the relatively static editions of most <em>livres d’artistes</em>, they are fully in keeping with the mission of an artist of the avant-garde. His ability to sustain this practice in the high-craft realm of the <em>livre d’artiste</em> while working with the most prominent artists of his time lends his work an unparalleled distinction.</p><p>How did he do it? Looking at his books today, we can see the deep thinking and ingenuity that were the foundations of his practice. We can also see why artists wanted to work with him: with Iliazd, they were not merely illustrators but collaborators in the creation of complex, hybrid works of art. That distinction means everything: the realization of the book itself as a work of art is Iliazd’s enduring legacy.</p>","Content_Quote":"","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"<p><a href=\"https://legionofhonor.famsf.org/iliazd-related-resources\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find more resources related to this project</a></p>","position":"0","id":12783809,"tier":5,"items":[]}]},{"_id":12783808,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":12783804,"_template_id":1370151,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"2","_name":"5.2 Right column image","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2021-05-28 17:20:11","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2021-06-09 19:09:32","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

One of the most successful gallerists of his time, he took a particular interest in livres d’artistes, producing editions with many of the great artists of the era, including Auguste Rodin, Raoul Dufy, Odilon Redon, Pablo Picasso, Georges Rouault, and others. He published twenty-four titles in all, leaving twenty-seven more projects in progress at his death, in 1939.</p><p>Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, born in 1884, was known for his prescient early support of the Cubist work of Picasso and Georges Braque, as well as his insightful appreciation of little-known writers of the avant-garde. The first livre d'artiste under his imprint, <em>L’enchanteur pourissant</em> (1909), was Guillaume Apollinaire’s first book, and featured André Derain’s first book illustrations.

It meant she was to assume the burden of maintaining [raising] and educating the children.” Separated for eighteen years, they never divorced and regularly corresponded until 1897. Mette promoted Gauguin by organizing several exhibitions and by selling his work. Numerous works in the exhibition belonged to Mette or passed through her hands. <br/><br/></p><p>When Mette and Gauguin married in 1873, he was working in Paris as a stock broker and was able to provide a comfortable middle-class lifestyle for their family, which grew to include four sons and a daughter. Gauguin’s exposure to the extensive art collection of his guardian, Gustave Arosa—including works by Eugène Delacroix and the foremost artists of the French Salon as well as ceramics from around the world—contributed to his developing passion for art. He further cultivated his interest by collecting more than fifty works by artists including Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Edgar Degas.</p>","Content_Quote":"","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"0","id":8226212,"tier":6,"items":[]},{"_id":8096894,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":8096801,"_template_id":1370541,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"1","_name":"Image","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2018-10-05 19:49:51","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2020-02-20 08:10:16","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

Two compositions—one painted at the beginning and one near the end of his career, <em>Still Life with Flowers </em>and <em>Flowers and Cats—</em>document the artist’s ingenuity and also his challenges. In <em>Still Life with Flowers</em>,<em> </em>Gauguin unsettled his traditional subject with the abstracted bedpost at the right of the composition, foreshadowing the enigmatic Symbolist style of his future work. Gauguin often introduced elements in his pictures to make his viewers wonder and question. By comparison, <em>Flowers and Cats </em>includes a bouquet of flowers Gauguin cultivated from seeds sent from France by a fellow artist. Painted in Tahiti, at the encouragement of his dealer, the painting shows Gauguin’s inability to completely abandon the art market and the culture of Europe.</p>","Content_Quote":"","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"0","id":8211002,"tier":5,"items":[]}]}]},{"_id":8252276,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":8108121,"_template_id":1370527,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"4","_name":"Chapter 4 content through end","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2018-11-16 01:00:17","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2020-11-06 23:35:14","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

Here I find the wild, the primitive. When my clogs echo on this granite earth, I hear the dull, muffled, powerful note that I am seeking in painting.” Gauguin’s <em>Landscape from Brittany with Breton Women</em> shows Brittany as an isolated French province, where time seems to stand still. The women wear their local dress complete with elaborate headdresses, and a cow ambles freely through a village. In Brittany, peasant beliefs blended Catholicism with ancestral practices, providing Gauguin with a world of symbols to inspire his art and spirituality.</p><p> </p><p>After his arrival in Tahiti, Gauguin was eager to learn about Tahitian beliefs from local residents and sites. In his partially fictional memoir, <em>Noa Noa</em>, which he later published in Paris to promote his Tahitian paintings, Gauguin describes receiving instruction about Tahitian theology from his <em><span>vahine</span></em>—companion and model—called Tehura (Teha’amana). However, it is evident that he drew heavily on an account of the islands by Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, <em><span>Voyages aux îles du Grand océan</span></em>, (<em><span>Travels to the Islands of the Pacific Ocean</span></em>), published in 1837. He used the text to infuse his paintings with religious images and themes. Although it looks like a painting from Tahiti, Gauguin painted <em><span>Reclining Tahitian Women</span></em> in Brittany in 1894 after his first sojourn to the islands.</p>","Content_Quote":"","Content_Quote-Attribution":"","Content_CTA-Button":"","position":"0","id":8108132,"tier":6,"items":[]}]}]},{"_id":8210990,"_project_id":190265,"_parent_id":8252276,"_template_id":1398142,"_custom_state_id":1208754,"_position":"0","_name":"Reclining Women w/ Zoom Markers","_notes":"","_type":"item","_overdue":false,"_archived_by":null,"_archived_at":null,"_created_at":{"date":"2018-11-02 18:32:30","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_updated_at":{"date":"2020-02-20 08:10:18","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"UTC"},"_status":{"data":{"id":"1208754","is_default":false,"position":"8","color":"#5eb95e","name":"Live on CMS","description":"Successfully published to the CMS.

These companions ranged in ages from 13 to 15, within the legal age of consent (13 in France at that time; 10 in California), and at least two of the relationships were perhaps facilitated by adult relatives. However, the women’s own preferences in entering these relationships are not documented or otherwise known. They were mentioned in his letters, featured in his journals, and were the subjects of many of his most striking artworks. They appear as models, muses, mothers, companions, and lovers—and as a Tahitian Eve.
